# greenpay-gatsby-frontend

A simple frontend for a South African payment site (original logo changed for client privacy).

Uses Gatsby for a statically built frontpage, and GraphQL to query a Contentful CMS.

You'd need your own .env file with a Contentful spaceId and accessToken, and obvs your own Contentful account with content/media, then amend the graphQL query to extract
your own content :)
